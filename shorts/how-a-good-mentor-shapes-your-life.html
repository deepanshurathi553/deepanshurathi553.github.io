                        <p>It's amazing that sometimes in your career, you find that one person or you have a meeting with that person that can change your day, a year or your life. I found some of them while building some APIs at Salesforce and it has never been the same. They helped me find my passion for Software Engineering, developing good coding habits, and the best part, I got my curiosity back. In this article, I'd discuss some of the qualities of a good mentor, and how it can affect your career or mindset and what to do if you think you found them.</p>
                        <h5>Love for the field</h5>
                        <p>A mentor who doesn't love the field they are in or the field you're trying to be in, will ultimately not make a good mentor. Enthusiasm for the field is catching and you'd want to feel that your job/work is meaningful and have the potential to create a good life for yourselves. If they doesn't genuinely have the enthusiasm for working in the field, they can make you feel the same about it, but if they really believe in the quality of work, that'd have the same impact on your mindset ultimately helping you to overcome the barriers or give you the strength to carry on.</p>

                        <h5>Expertise or Knowledge in the field</h5>
                        <p>This may seem obvious but you mentor should have relevant skillset or experience in the field that you can look up to. If you're not inspired by the knowledge or mindset of that person, it's highly likely you'll lose respect and not learn anything. They should be able to help propel you forward because they’ve been there, seen the landscape, and know what it takes to be successful. Although one thing has to be taken care here is that there is not too much of an experience gap. Because, The modern workplace is constantly changing, so what was common practice in your mentor’s prime may no longer be relevant.</p>

                        <h5>Open to learning and growth happening in the field</h5>
                        <p>Mentors are in a position to illustrate how the field is growing and changing and that even after many years there are still new things to learn. Anyone that feels stagnant in their current position will not make a good mentor. When starting out in a new career, people want to feel that the time and energy they spend learning will be rewarded and will ultimately provide them with career satisfaction. Good mentors continually read professional journals and may even write articles on subjects where they have developed some expertise.</p>

                        <h5>Willingness to share skills, knowledge, and expertise.</h5>
                        <p>Each person is living their own life and have their own set of problems, their own goals and preferences. So it becomes really important that whether the mentor have the enthusiasm for this relationship or not. A good mentor is willing to teach what he/she knows and accept the mentee where they currently are in their professional development. Good mentors can remember what it was like just starting out in the field. The mentor does not take the mentoring relationship lightly and understands that good mentoring requires time and commitment and is willing to continually share information and their ongoing support with the mentee. <b>Just as important as your mentor having expertise is them being willing to share it with you.</b></p>

                        <h5>Ability to give honest and constructive feedback</h5>
                        <p>A good mentor knows how to deliver feedback in a way that’s constructive, kind, and direct, and doesn’t shy away from being honest because they’re afraid of hurting your feelings. It is one of the key responsibilities of a good mentor is to provide guidance and constructive feedback to their mentee. This is where the mentee will most likely grow the most by identifying their current strengths and weaknesses and learning how to use these to make themselves successful in the field. Basically, you want someone who’s willing to call you out on your BS, because rarely can you get that kind of perspective in the workplace. Eventually, You'll start making better decisions for yourself and that will foster professional development and a feeling of accomplishment in learning the field.</p>

                        <p>Here are some of the question you can ask yourselves to spot these qualities to find a good mentor -</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Are they happy with the field you're working in?</li>
                            <li>Are you inspired by the depth and breath of their knowledge and expertise?</li>
                            <li>Do they seem to invest in and enjoy being a part of others’ success?</li>
                            <li>Do they speak in a truthful and respectful manner?</li>
                            <li>Are they invested in their own growth and development?</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>You should also remember that having a mentor isn’t about becoming  the person, rather, <b>you’re aspiring to have their skills and to gain the knowledge that they have.</b> Everyone’s seeking their own definition of a successful career, and chances are yours will look much different than your mentor’s. Rely on them for guidance and encouragement, but make sure you’re continuing to do what feels right for you.</p>
